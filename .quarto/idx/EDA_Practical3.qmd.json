The transformed data is stored in df_zscore.\n\nZ-score normalization is a type of data standardization where we convert all features in our dataset to have a mean (µ) of 0 and a standard deviation (σ) of 1. The purpose of this transformation is to remove the scale effect of measurements.\n\nThe formula for Z-score normalization is:\n\nZ = (X - µ) / σ\n\nwhere:\n\nZ is the standardized (Z-score normalized) value, X is the original value, µ is the mean of the feature, σ is the standard deviation of the feature. Why do we do this? In machine learning, many algorithms (like K-nearest neighbors, Neural Networks, and others) perform better when their input features are roughly on the same scale and centered around zero. If one feature has a range of -1 to 1, while another feature has a range of -1000 to 1000, the second feature will completely dominate when these features are combined, even though the first feature might be just as important.\n\nAfter Z-score normalization, every feature in the dataset will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, putting them all on roughly the same scale. The data values in each column now represent how many standard deviations the original value was from the mean of that column. This makes it easier to compare different features, and helps many machine learning algorithms perform better.\n\n```{python}\n\n# Z-score normalization\nscaler = preprocessing.StandardScaler()\ndf_zscore = pd.DataFrame(scaler.fit_transform(df), columns=data.feature_names)\nprint(\"\\nAfter Z-score Normalization:\\n\", df_zscore.head())\n\n# Let's plot the data after Z-score normalization\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.kdeplot(data=df_zscore)\nplt.title(\"After Z-score Normalization\")\nplt.show()\n\n```\n\n\n#### Your Task\n\n## Question 1:\n\n```         \n1.1 Load the Bupa Data set and apply a new transformations from <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html> to a feature of your choice\n1.2 Remove the Label column (\"selector\") from the data set.\n1.3 Visualize the data before and after the feature transformation using boxplots. \n```\n\nYou can download the dataset through the link:\n\n-   [bupa.csv](bupa.csv)\n\n```{python}\n#df_bupa = pd.read_csv('bupa.csv')\n#df_bupa = df_bupa.dropna()\n\n\n#print(df_bupa)\n\n\n```\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nWe are now continuing with Python and pre-processing functions.
